It's been three Februaries since I started working at Facebook, and I feel like every time around this time of the year, work just accelerates to an almost impossible to keep up speed. The first year I joined, we were rolling out our newly finished product, fighting against deadlines . 

Now it feels like I'm the camel and I'm nearing the limit to the amount of straws I can carry on my back. 

It's still kind of crazy how tech salaries can grow so fast. I started less than three years ago, and factoring in stock appreciation, it has more than tripled. I wouldn't say it's easy money - tech is one of those things that's hard to get out of your mind even once your hours end. Sometimes I'd wake up in the middle of night and find that my mind was on blocks and blobs and everything to do with work. Other times my partner would get mad at me for being silent after work, because I was so concentrated on thinking about work that I couldn't even hear her voice. 

I'm still kind of at a disbelief that I got RE twice. I feel like a lot of it resides on my manager. When he was a tech lead, he really demonstrated care for the products we owned, and now that he's a manager, I feel like that same kind of meticulous attitude he had towards maintaining and improving our services has been transferred onto his direct reports. And he has a lot of reports! I hope he doesn't burn himself out. I feel like it's also partly because he's a new manager and is still learning the ropes and because of which ____. For example he stayed up all night to write our psc packets - if it was Grace's manager, I'm sure he would've just given up and went to sleep. 

But overall, given my complete inexperience in the industry, it's kind of crazy that the salary I get is comparable to . What makes things worse is my immediate circle is also all tech related, so I don't even really feel the blessing that I have unless I take the time to really think about it. Driving through the Bay Area during my offsite did make me think about it though. Here I was, passing rows and rows of dingy looking cottage homes that were probably decades old, the owners of which were most definitely multi-millionaires. 

It feels almost like a drain, where the world's wealth is being sucked into this one central location called Sillicon Valley. People here design chips, build hardware and software products that are used by the majority of the worlds population, in the process siphoning their wealth and concentrating it within the people working at these companies. On one hand, I'm absolutely grateful to Mark Z for refusing to conspire with the other big tech companies to artificially limit the tech workers' salary, but on the other it feels kind of uncomfortable how the world's wealth can be so unequally concentrated[look for new word].  asdf
