[Cats & Soup](https://www.instagram.com/catsnsoup.official/) is an idle clicker game featuring cute cats that tirelessly make a variety of dishes to sell to buy more cats and expand your little dish-making business in the middle of the woods. However, despite the smooth and gorgeous animations and UI, for the handful of times over the past year or two I've picked it up, I never played for more than a few days before putting it down and never touching it again (for a few months, until the next road trip or plane ride compels me to try again). And that is because its core gameplay mechanic is ad-watching.

As a disclaimer, I'm okay with ads as a business model in general. I'll gladly give every last byte of my personal data to Google if it meant I could continue using Google Maps and YouTube for free.
