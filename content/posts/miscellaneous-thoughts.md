My current job is great. I don't face moral dilemmas that product teams face of whether we can push engagement on our apps at the cost of doing the "right thing". All we care about is making our systems more reliable, more scalable, more efficient, which presents intellectually challenging problems that have everyone's best interests at heart - our users since they get a faster, snappier product; zuck because he spends less money on infra; me, because I get to solve cool problems. However, in product, they refuse to solve the "rug pull" problem where when you open up instagram it shows old content for a second or two before it receives the new content from the server, and "pulls the rug" underneath the users feet by replacing what's currently displayed with the new content against their will, all because various fixes all show a decrease in overall engagement. I hope I never have to make those sorts of decisions.
