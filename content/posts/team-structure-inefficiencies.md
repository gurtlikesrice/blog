Why do PEs exist? And why are they separate from SWEs. I feel like this team structure is really not very efficient

1. PEs don't have clear ownership of mainline services, and often feel left out.

2. SWEs disincentivized to do "PE" work
part of 1

3. Added latency for information flow
lots of meetings are SWE only, like determining forward vision of team, what is going to be worked on, etc.
